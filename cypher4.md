# Cypher 4

The Hexadecimal on the inside of the Front of the coin is our next challenge.

The clue from the previous cypher was `XOR HEX A5D75`, but since `A5 D7 5` is not a complete set of bytes (we are missing 4 bits, or one hex character) lets duplicate it so that it's complete like this `A5 D7 5A 5D 75`
